Does the mean or the median better summarize the backers count data?

The median is more accurate than the mean to describe the overall amount of backers, because the mean is skewed by the high outliers of this dataset. If the mean were chosen the overall success of these crowdfunding campaigns would be represented incorrectly.


What are the results of the variability?

The variance for successful backers count is higher than the failed backers count. This indicates that the number of backers is more widely dispersed from low to high. While variance may prove useful for other data in this dataset, the backer count is not enough to draw any meaningful conclusions. Differences in backers could be due to goal amount and/or category of the crowfunding campaign.
